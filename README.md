# MAJOR PROJECT 2023

This project proposes a system for measuring object sizes using OpenCV and ArUco markers. The system utilizes a camera to capture images of the object of interest, with ArUco markers used as reference points for size estimation. The image processing is performed using OpenCV libraries, which provide robust marker identification and tracking capabilities. By calculating the distance between the markers and the object, the system can determine the size of the object accurately and quickly, without any contact. This method of object size measurement has several advantages, such as being non-destructive, contactless, and fast, making it ideal for use in quality control, industrial inspection, and 3D modeling.
In this project, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system by performing various experiments with different objects and markers. We compare the results obtained by the proposed method with the ground truth measurements and show that the proposed system can achieve accurate and precise object size measurements with an error of less than 5%. Furthermore, we also analyze the effect of different camera parameters on the measurement accuracy and present some practical recommendations for optimizing the system's performance.
This project presents a robust, accurate, and non-contact method for object size measurement using OpenCV and ArUco markers, which can have a wide range of applications in different industries.
